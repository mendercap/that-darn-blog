Hello, I'm Zi and this is my new sewing blog ... sort of.

2018 was a year of many changes for me - my lifestyle was changing, my body was changing, free space was disappearing fast in my home and my laundry was multiplying exponentially. (Any parents reading this may have guessed that I had a baby!).

With these new changes came a need for new clothing. But as someone who has become increasingly more conscious of the ethical and sustainable shortcomings of the fashion industry, I decided to not buy any new clothing for myself in 2019. I made a goal to only:

- Mend or refashion what I already had;
- Sew any new pieces I needed; OR
- Purchase pre-loved items.

(With a few exceptions - socks, underwear, bras, hosiery, swimwear, activewear, hats, bags and shoes.)

So in this blog you will find chronicles of my sewing ... but also of my mending, refashioning, thrifting, possibly knitting, and the odd post on sustainable living. If this kind of thing interests you, there'll be a new post every fortnight. :)
