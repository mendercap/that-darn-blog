I'm currently enjoying a holiday hiatus. Given it's the start of a new year though, I've been thinking about how I went with my 2019 slow fashion goal and what I plan to do from now on.

In my first blog post I mentioned that 2019 would be a year of no new clothing and instead:

- Mending or refashioning what I already had
- Sewing any new pieces I needed
- Purchasing pre-loved items

(With the exceptions of socks, underwear, bras, hosiery, swimwear, activewear, hats, bags and shoes.)

**So, did I stick with my goal?**

Yes!

**What did I actually mend, make and purchase?**

Mended/Refashioned:
6 items

Made:
1 pair of pants

Purchased Pre-loved:
3 dresses
3 tops
3 skirts

Purchased Brand New:
3 pairs of stockings
3 pairs of socks
1 backpack

(Full disclosure here â€” I was also given a tshirt for Christmas.)

**How hard/easy was it?**

It was quite easy. But, in all honesty, I wonder if this is due to being a new parent. I was pretty busy navigating all things baby, and I wonder if any sub-conscious desire to buy brand new garments was fulfilled by buying new clothes for my little one.

**What will I continue or change in the new year?**

I'll be sticking with my three rules in the new year, with the addition of one more and a few other sewing and sustainability goals.

In 2020, I plan to:

- Mend or refashion what I already have
- Sew any new pieces I need
- Purchase pre-loved items
- Only buy from ethical or sustainable brands

Last year I found most items I needed pre-loved, but there were few items I couldn't find that I was hoping to sew. However, my need for them far outweighed my sewing speed and time, so I've given myself another option.

I'm also hoping to sew more for my little one using fabric scraps and reduce food waste in our house. I'll keep you posted on how I go.

I hope you too have found some time to rest and recharge. And I wish you all the best for the year ahead. ðŸ™‚
