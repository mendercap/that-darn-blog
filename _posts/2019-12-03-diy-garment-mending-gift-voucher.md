Christmas is fast approaching, so I thought I would share a small gift that I've made for some family and friends â€” a Garment Mending Gift Voucher.

If you are a sewist who would like to give the gift of mending, then feel free to download the template and make some yourself.

PLEASE NOTE: The template is intended to be printed double-sided on A4 paper (in case it helps, I printed mine in "actual size" and to "flip on short edge" in my printer settings).

Below are some photos of how to construct one, but there are also instructions on the template. ðŸ™‚
